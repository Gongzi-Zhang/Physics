\section{Introduction}

EOM: one can derive it from action (the smallest action principle). As for the
action, it should abey some symmetric rules, for example, in relativity, the 
action should be \emph{Lorentz invariant} and \emph{Gauge invariant}. 

The tools of QM: Perturbation theory (P.T. both time-dependent and time-independent)

QFT is just QM with an infinite number of Harmonic Oscillator (H.O.)

In QM (QFT), the basic idea behind renormalization -- infinities can appear in intermediate
calculations, but they must drop out of physical observables.
