The tools of QM: Perturbation theory (P.T. both time-dependent and time-independent)

QFT is just QM with an infinite number of Harmonic Oscillator (H.O.)

In QM (QFT), the basic idea behind renormalization -- infinities can appear in intermediate
calculations, but they must drop out of physical observables.
