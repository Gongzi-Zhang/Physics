\subsection{Examples}
A object moves in velocity $\vec{v} = v_0\hat{x}$, then in the 
object rest frame K', we measure its length as $l_0$; and the
proper time for an evnet as $d\tau$; then in the lab frame, what 
we meaure are $L$ and $dt$:

    %%%%%%%%% A %%%%%%%%%%% 
    \item [adjoint representation]
    \item [analyticity]
    \item [associativity of addition and multiplication]    
	$a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c$   , and $a\cdot(b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot c$
    \item [bilinear]	In QFT, a bilinear term means it has exactly two
	fields. Such as:
	\[ \mathcal{L}_K \supset \frac{1}{2}\phi\Box\phi,
	\frac{1}{4}F^2_{\mn}, \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2,
	\frac{1}{2}\phi_1\Box\phi_2, \phi_1\partial_\mu A_\mu, \dots \]

	\[  C:\quad\psi\rightarrow-i\gamma_2\psi^*\equiv\psi_C	\]
	In the Weyl basis, $\gamma_2^*=-\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_2^T=\gamma_2$, so
	\[  C:\quad\psi^*\rightarrow-i\gamma_2\psi  \]
    \item [chirality] The handedness of a spinor is referred to as its
	chirality. The \textbf{left-handed} and \textbf{right-handed} 
	refer to the ($\frac{1}{2},0$) or (0,$\frac{1}{2}$) representations
	of the Lorentz group. This concept only exists for spinors, or more
	precisely for (A,B) representations of the Lorentz group with
	$A\neq B$. Almost always, chirality means that a theory is not
	symmetric between left-handed Weyl spinors $\psi_L$ and right-handed
	spinors $\psi_R$

	\]
    \item [Dirac equation]
	\[  
	    (i\slashed{D} -m)\psi =0	
	\]
    \item [Dirac Mass]
	\[  
	    \mathcal{L}_{\text{Dirac mass}} = m(\psi_L^\dag\psi_R + \psi^\dag_R\psi_L) 
	\]
    \item [Distributivity of multiplication over addition]
	$a\cdot(b+c)=(a\cdot b) + (a\cdot c)$

    %%%%%%%%% E %%%%%%%%%%% 
    \item [equipartion theorem] a body in thermal equilibrium should have
	energy equally distributed among all possible modes, (mode is a
	seperation of phase space), which means all modes have the same
	energy.

    %%%%%%%%% F %%%%%%%%%%% 
    \item [faithful representation] A representation in which each group
	element gets its own matrix is called a \emph{faithful
	representation}.
    \item [Fermi's golden rule]	$\Gamma \sim |\mathcal{M}|^{2}\delta(E_f - E_i)$
    \item [first principle]

    %%%%%%%%% G %%%%%%%%%%% 
    \item [Gauge transform] $\phi \rightarrow e^{-i\alpha}\phi$
    \item [good quantum number] which doesn't change along time. $[Q, H] = 0$
    \item [Grassmann Numbers] For Majorana masses to be non-trivial, fermion 
	compnents cannot be regular numbers, they must be anticommuting numbers. 
	Such things are called Grassmann numbers.

    %%%%%%%%% H %%%%%%%%%%% 
    \item [Helicity] spin projected on the direction of motion is called the
	helicity. $\hat{h}=\frac{\vec{\sigma}\cdot\vec{p}}{|\vec{p}|}$

    \item [Levi-Civita] $\epsilon_{ijk} = \left\{
	\begin{aligned}
	    1\quad  normal order(123,231,312) \\
	    -1\quad reverse order(132,213,321)	\\
	    0\quad  otherwise	\\
	\end{aligned} \right.$
    \item [Lie algebra] the generators of the Lie group form an algebra
	called its Lie algebra. 
    \item [Lie groups]	Lie groups are a class of groups, including the
	Lorentz group, with an infinite number of elements but a finite
	number of generators.
    \item [lightlike]	$V^\mu V_\mu = 0$
    \item [Lippmann-Schwinger eqn] 
	In P.T.
	\[
	    H = H_0 + V (correction)
	    \]
	If 
	\[
	    H_0\ket{\phi} = E\ket{\phi}, \quad and \quad 
	    H\ket{\psi} = E\ket{\psi}
	    \]
	Then
	\[
	    \ket{\psi} = \ket{\phi} + \frac{1}{E-H_0}V\ket{\psi}
	    \]
	This is called the \textbf{Lippmann-Schwinger equation}. And the inverted object 
	is a kind of Green's function known as the \textbf{Lippmann-Schwinger kernel}:
	\[
	    \prod_{LS} = \frac{1}{E-H_0}
	    \]
	Define operator T, so that
	\[
	    V\ket{\psi} = T\ket{\phi}
	    \]
	So
	\[
	    \ket{\psi} = \ket{\phi} + \frac{1}{E-H_0}T\ket{\phi}
	    \]
	and 
	\[
	    T = V + V\frac{1}{E-H_0}T
	    \]
	Solve it perturbatively in V:
	\[
	    \begin{aligned}
		T &= V + V\frac{1}{E-H_0}V + V\frac{1}{E-H_0}V\frac{1}{E-H_0}V + \cdots

	    \end{aligned}
	    \]

    \item [little group] The representation of the full \Poincare{}
	group is induced by a representation of the subgorup of the
	\Poincare{} group that holds $p^\mu$ fixed, called the
	\emph{little group}. When $P_\mu$ is massive, the little group is
	SO(3); when $p_\mu$ is massless, the little group is ISO(2).
    \item [locality]
    \item [Lorentz group] this is the generalization of the rotation group
	to include both rotations and boosts.

    \item [quantum process]  time evolution of an open quantum system ???

    %%%%%%%%% R %%%%%%%%%%% 
    \item [Rarita-Schwinger field]  spin-$\frac{3}{2}$
    \item [representation] A set of objects that mix under a transformation
	group is called a representation of the group, though technically
	the matrix embedding is the representation. A representation is a 
	particular embedding of group elements into operators that act on a 
	vector space. For finite-dimensional representations, this means an 
	embedding of the $g_i$ into matrices. 

    %%%%%%%%% S %%%%%%%%%%% 
    \item [second quantization]	canonical quantization of relativistic
	fields, 
	\[  H_0 = \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^3}\omega_p(a^{\dag}_p a_p +
	\frac{1}{2}) \] 
	First quantization refer to the discrete mode, for
	example, of a particle in a box. Second quantization refers to the
	integer numbers of excitations of each of these modes. There are two
	features in second quantization:
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item We have many quantum mechanical systems - one for each
		$\vec{p}$ - all at the same time.
	    \item We interpret the nth excitation of the $\vec{p}$ harmonic
		oscillator as having n \emph{particles}.
	\end{enumerate}

    \item [time dilation] In relativity, time dilation is a difference in 
	the elapsed time measured by two observers.
    \item [timelike]	$V^\mu V_\mu > 0$

    %%%%%%%%% U %%%%%%%%%%%

	    \begin{pmatrix}
		0   & \sigma_\mu    \\
		\bar{\sigma}_\mu  & 0	\\
	    \end{pmatrix} 
	\]
    \item [$\gamma^5$]
	\[
	    \gamma^5 \equiv i\gamma^0\gamma^1\gamma^2\gamma^3
	\]
	In the Weyl representation:
	\[
