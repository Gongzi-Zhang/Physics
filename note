* derivation of Lorentz transformation
* How an open-open end tube (like flute) to form standing waves?


# key concepts
EOS: Equation of State
EOM: Equation of Motion


Newton mechanics & Lagrangian
Nearest atom interaction and phonon
ab initio & Effective DFT

I have seen DFT in quite a few fields: solid physics, nuclear physics
Density Functional Theory: minimization of DF to produce a ground state
The problem is how to decide the density functional: which usually depends on some particle density and associate current ($\particl \rho$)

What's the intuitive physical explanation of Halmitonian Equations?

\b{LS-coupling notation\}
    ^(2S+1)L_J
    with L=0 is an S state; L=1 is an P state; L=2 D state; L=3 F state, the
    names come from 19th century verbal descriptions of "spectral lines" on
    photongraphic plates: sharp, principal, diffuse, fundamental, etc.


completeness, orthogonal, localization.


\b{dielectric\}
    the proportionality between external field and induced total field.
