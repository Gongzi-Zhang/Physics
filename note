What's the intuitive physical explanation of Halmitonian Equations?

\b{LS-coupling notation\}
    ^(2S+1)L_J
    with L=0 is an S state; L=1 is an P state; L=2 D state; L=3 F state, the
    names come from 19th century verbal descriptions of "spectral lines" on
    photongraphic plates: sharp, principal, diffuse, fundamental, etc.


completeness, orthogonal, localization.


\b{dielectric\}
    the proportionality between external field and induced total field.
