\section{Keep things simple}
Try to understand and tell story the simple and intuitive way, try to connnect  to the most simple and easiest principles.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conservation \&\& Symmetry
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Energy E
	    \item Momentum P
	    \item Charge Q
	\end{itemize}

    \item Monotonic increasement
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Entropy
	\end{itemize}

    \item Monotonic decreasement

    \item Maximum

    \item Minimum

    \item Periodity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Approximation, Guess, and Extrapolation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scale}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The techniqal complexities associated with a partile increase with its spin.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Oscillation
    \item Two-level system
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Constant
    \item Linear (polynomial)
    \item Exponential
    \item $$sin$$ and $$cos$$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Frequenctly used}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gauss function
    \item Fourier transform
\end{itemize}
