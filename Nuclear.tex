\chapter{Nuclear}

Topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item how to calculate nuclear spin and magnetic dipole moment
\end{itemize}

Nuclear structure

Approches:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start from a QCD-inspired model of hadron structure => Ask how that internal structure is modified in-medium => which will lead to saturation + predictions for all hadrons => Derive effective forces => Test predictions for quantities sensitive to internal structure (structure functions, form factors in-medium)
    \item Quark-Meson Coupling (QMC): start with quark model (MIT bag/NJL...) for all hadrons => Introduce a relativistic Lagrangian with $\sigma, \omega$ and $\rho$ mesons coupling to non-strange quarks (hence only 3 parameters: $g^q_{\sigma, \omega, \rho}$) => fit to saturation properties of nuclear matter

\end{itemize}

Nuclear observables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item binding energy
    \item symmetry energy (E/A)
    \item charge radii
    \item surface thickness
    \item Nucleon density
    \item Energy slope (L)
\end{itemize}
