\subsection{Solid State}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{n} \sim \frac{4}{3}\pir_s^3 \Rightarrow \frax{r_s}{a_0} \sim 2-6
\end{equation}
where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius, n is the number of atoms per unit volume.

\subsection{Accelerator}
It's hard to have from $10^9-10^{11}$ particles per bunch.

\subsection{Atomic Physics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Screening effect (visible light) > fine (hyperfine) interaction
\end{itemize}
