\chapter{Q \& A}
Q: why we assume that the frequency of light keeps unchanged when cross over the intermedia surface between two different materials?
A: because light is massless, its energy depends on $\omega$: $E = \hbar\omega$,according to energy conservation, the energy should not change, so its frequency keeps unchanged.
