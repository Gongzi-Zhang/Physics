\subsection{Selection rule}
Circularly polarized photons carry angular momentum $\pm 1$ ($\hbar$) directed along the propagation direction $\hat{z}$, and the \emph{selection rule} for allowed transitions is $\Delta m = \pm 1$ when the quantization axis is taken to be the $\hat{z}$ direction. For linearly polarized photons the selection rule is $\Delta m = 0$ with the quantization axis along the polarized direction.
