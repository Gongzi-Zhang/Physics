> One of the great mysteries at the time of Isaac Newton was understanding how the Moon was affected by the Earth or, in other words, how gravity worked. It’s the same thing with electromagnetics. What happens between two charged particles that are attracted to each other or repel each other? This is what the theory of quantum electrodynamics explains. It holds that the electron is surrounded by a cloud of ‘virtual’ photons that are emitted and reabsorbed. If another electron enters the cloud, photons are exchanged.
